      <description>Electoral Predictions and forecasts often cite the “political environment” that a given election cycle is taking place in. For example, pundits could cite a growing economy as cause for a good environment for incumbents while troubling foreign policy incidents might add to a bad environment for incumbents. These “fundamentals” exist outside the campaign’s control and set the stage for a given election cycle. But, how accurately can we predict elections with these conditions alone?</description>

      <description>This blog is being completed as part of GOV 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard College taught by Professor Ryan Enos. It will be updated weekly and culminate in a predictive model of the 2022 midterm elections.
In this first blog post, I aim to familiarize myself with tidyverse and github through an exploration of popular vote margins and seat share margins during the 2018 midterm election cycle. I then explore what these visualizations reveal about Gerrymandering across the United States.</description>
