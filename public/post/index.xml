      <description>Introduction: This week we transitioned away from studying “The Fundamentals” of elections and turned to focus more precisely on studying campaigns themselves. We began our exploration of campaign outreach by examining the impact of ads in shaping election outcomes.
Blog Extension: Ad Spending in 2018
I first visualized the ad data in order to look at when campaigns spend on ads. From the 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 data it becomes clear that ads spending really begins to pick up in October and continues to increase through election day.</description>

      <description>This week’s blog aims to look at the accuracy of expert ratings and how they can be incorporated into our model. I also begin modeling at the district level as opposed to the national models I have worked on over the last three weeks.
I began by mapping the Democratic vote share in the 2018 midterm election cycle at the district level.

D, Likely D, Safe D) corresponds to a value 1-7 with 1 being a safe Democratic seat and 7 being a safe Republican seat.</description>

      <description>Using Polling to Inform Election Forecasts
Last week, I built a model for the 2022 midterm elections based on the historical relationship between change in Real Disposable Income and election outcome (either Popular Vote Share or Seat Share). While that model was far from perfect and exhibited a great degree of uncertainty, by limiting the data to midterm yebuiars only, I was able to raise the r-squared value to 0.</description>

      <description>Electoral Predictions and forecasts often cite the “political environment” that a given election cycle is taking place in. For example, pundits could cite a growing economy as cause for a good environment for incumbents while troubling foreign policy incidents might add to a bad environment for incumbents. These “fundamentals” exist outside the campaign’s control and set the stage for a given election cycle. But, how accurately can we predict elections with these conditions alone?</description>

      <description>This blog is being completed as part of GOV 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard College taught by Professor Ryan Enos. It will be updated weekly and culminate in a predictive model of the 2022 midterm elections.
In this first blog post, I aim to familiarize myself with tidyverse and github through an exploration of popular vote margins and seat share margins during the 2018 midterm election cycle. I then explore what these visualizations reveal about Gerrymandering across the United States.</description>

      <description>To begin looking at the relationship between party vote share and turnout, I graphed regressions of both the republican or democrat party vote share on turnout. The graph can be seen below. As pictured, the republican party vote share has a slight negative correlation with turnout while the democrat party vote share has a slight positive correlation with turnout. While the impact doesn’t seem incredibly significant, it seems that greater turnout is a benefit for the democratic party historically.</description>
